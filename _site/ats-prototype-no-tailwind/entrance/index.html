                A carousel of images. First image is of me, a white femme, in bed with my heating pads and pillows. I’m doing a smile which has always been a little rough around the edges 😅 Squinting as well. I’ve got oversized glasses on and a black and white headband with a bow. Light pink hair with dark brown roots feathered in. A brick wall is behind me, I need a pretty headboard for sure. Second image is a video where Olive, my dog, is wrapped up in her tortilla blanket. She’s unsure of the world and looks slightly concerned. Same olive, same. Third image is a pixelated Garfield where he has a paintbrush paint can and is sitting in a box. He’s saying I’ve painted eyeballs on my eyelids… Fourth image is of my washed out service dog blueberry sitting in the back of my car on her x x x l dog bed. She has a bit of teenage acne in this pic and she is holding a George toy from Peppa Pig which she stole from my niece because she’s so obsessed with it for some reason. My sister said it was ok 🙏🏻❤️
