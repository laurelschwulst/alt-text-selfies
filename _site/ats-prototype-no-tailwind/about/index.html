                <em>What is an alt-text selfie?</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                For us, an alt-text selfie is any written self-portrait. This project takes a well-known practice—the selfie—and approaches it through a disability lens. Selfies and self-descriptions are often visually focused, but to us, an alt-text selfie doesn’t need to center visual presentation or a literal description of an image. Alt-text selfies might focus on feelings, smells, tastes, sounds, emotions, textures, or some combination. Alt-text selfies can be any length, but for this project, we focused on writing in the one-sentence to one-paragraph range.

                <em>What is alt-text?</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Alternative text, or alt-text, is a written description of an image or visual material. Put another way, alt-text is a non-visual text alternative to digital images. Alt-text is an essential part of web accessibility and is one way to create access to visual content for people who are blind, low vision, or have certain cognitive disabilities.

                <em>Why are we making this project?</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Description is an important access practice. Visual description—as well as descriptions of sound, taste, smell, and texture—are ways that we can connect across sensory experiences and distance. Like many access practices, description has often been approached in a dry and compliance-oriented way. We’re excited about the possibilities of description that are pleasurable and make the Internet, in particular, a more engaging and welcoming place for disabled people.
            </p>

            <p>
                Description and self-description are also complex. How do we name and acknowledge visual (and non-visual) markers of our identities? How we see and name things is anything but neutral. Disabled people, especially multi-marginalized disabled people, have been writing self-descriptions online in thoughtful and inventive ways. To us, it is a vital facet of disability cultures. We are creating this project in order to celebrate this writing practice. As well, by paying closer attention to self-description, alt-text selfies may give us new tools or ways of understanding and describing ourselves.
            </p>

            <p>
                As we explore the medium of alt-text selfies, accessibility will remain our priority with this project. We are not interested in producing work that results in less access for people who rely on alternative text to access digital content.
