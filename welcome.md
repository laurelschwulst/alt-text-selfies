Thank you for being here with our project, a celebration and collection of alt text selfies (self-portrait descriptions that are shared online).

Alt text selfie is an open term. Our understanding of what an alt text selfie might be is always shifting and changing. Selfies and self-descriptions are often visually focused, but, to us, an alt text selfie doesn't need to center around visuals, or literally describe an image. As the selfies gathered on this website exemplify, alt text selfies can blend smell, taste, touch, sound, and more. At their core, alt text selfies are an access practice, tools for connecting across sensory experiences and distance.

Thank you for checking out our alt-text experiment. We are so happy you are here!
