    <div class="selfie-container">
        <div class="content" id="transcript"><p>Before a wall of glass bricks, I lean against a splintering wooden post. I am smirking. My lips are ample and I never show my teeth. My dimples remind my family of Beau Bridges but I miss the reference entirely. I have a salt &amp; cayenne pepper beard: deep red &amp; grey. It hangs about 4 inches below my chin and climbs like thick moss up my face. My moustache curls inwards. I’ve had it since Y2K . . . My eyebrows are bushy like a wizard’s and my eyes are deep blue as I’ve been told but not everyone can agree on that. They are focused straight ahead with the left one turning inward.</p>
<p>My high forehead is topped by shoulder length dirty blond hair. It curls at the ends like an unravelled treasure map or parchment. My hands are on my hips, pushing back my unbuttoned red denim jacket. My belt buckle is a large silver octopus. Even though the buckle is worth noting it is not the reason that I’m holding open my jacket. My t-shirt has a large airbrush portrait of myself with Tupac on my left and biggie on my right. We all have blunts in our mouths. The quality of the air brushing is that of an independent vendor at the Mega mall. It is impressive enough to be considered professional but with the perfect amount of awkward proportions and fucked up perspectives that proves the dude was no perfectionist. Reconsidering the details of my T-shirt we can now understand that my smirk is one filled with confidence and, “that’s right . . . That’s me, motherfucker. This is a custom fit.&quot; The left leg of my well-worn black jeans crosses over the right. The tip of my black Chelsea boot digs into the dirty asphalt.</p>
<p>Above my head is a paper flyer that is stapled to the wooden post. The focus of the flyer is a large, bold, black arrow pointing down towards my head. Above the arrow are the words, “it’s true!” handwritten in black cursive. My white tipped cane lays flat on the asphalt and up against the glass brick wall. If you believe that the actions of an inanimate object could be considered blasé then that’s what would totally apply to this here cane.</p>
